# External skills — provenance and re-sync

This template vendors a small set of external, community-maintained skills
into `.claude/skills/` alongside the skills authored for this repo (Layers
1–3). Vendoring means the upstream skill content is copied in-tree, at a
pinned commit, with its license preserved — not installed as a live
dependency. This keeps the skill set reproducible (no surprise upstream
changes between sessions) and keeps attribution intact.

Only 4 external skills are vendored. Everything else in `.claude/skills/` is
authored for this template.

| `react-native-guidelines` | [vercel-labs/agent-skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills) | `f8a72b9603728bb92a217a879b7e62e43ad76c81` | MIT (declared in README "License" section + the skill's own `SKILL.md` frontmatter; no top-level `LICENSE` file upstream — see the vendored `LICENSE`) | `tmp=$(mktemp -d) && git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills "$tmp/vercel" && rm -rf .claude/skills/react-native-guidelines && cp -R "$tmp/vercel/skills/react-native-skills" .claude/skills/react-native-guidelines && ( cd "$tmp/vercel" && git rev-parse HEAD ) > .claude/skills/react-native-guidelines/.upstream-commit && rm -rf "$tmp"` |

Each vendored folder contains, in addition to the skill content:

- `SKILL.md` — valid frontmatter (`name:` + `description:`), required for
  Claude Code to discover and load the skill.
- `LICENSE` — the upstream license (copied verbatim where a `LICENSE` file
  existed upstream; reproduced with a provenance note where the repo only
  declared its license in prose — see the per-skill notes below).
- `.upstream-commit` — the exact commit the vendored copy was cut from. Diff
  against a fresh clone at this commit to see if upstream has drifted.

No skill was left install-only — all 4 requested skills carried a
redistribution-permissive license (MIT in every case), so all 4 were vendored
in full rather than recorded as an `npx`/plugin-install pointer.

### Per-skill notes

- **`react-native-best-practices`** — upstream folder: `skills/react-native-best-practices/`
  in `software-mansion-labs/skills`. Ships a top-level `SKILL.md` plus a
  `references/` tree (animations, gestures, SVG, JSI, multithreading,
  on-device AI, audio, rich text) — vendored whole. The same upstream repo
  also contains a `skills/radon-mcp/` skill; **that one is intentionally
  excluded** (not selected for this template — Radon IDE/MCP debugging tooling
  is out of scope here).
- **`react-native-guidelines`** — upstream folder: `skills/react-native-skills/`
  in `vercel-labs/agent-skills` (upstream `SKILL.md` frontmatter names it
  `vercel-react-native-skills`). Renamed to `react-native-guidelines` on
  vendor so the skill's `name:` matches this template's folder name and the
  task's requested identifier; the original upstream name is preserved in
  `metadata.upstream_name` in the frontmatter and called out in a note at the
  top of the vendored `SKILL.md` body. Content (the `rules/` directory of
  focused React Native/Expo lint-style rules) is otherwise unmodified.
- **`ui-ux-pro-max`** — upstream ships a pre-built, ready-to-use Claude Code
  skill directory at `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/` (there's also a
  `src/ui-ux-pro-max/` "source of truth" used by the repo's own build/CLI to
  generate per-platform variants — that one has extra/different CSV rows for
  stacks this template doesn't target, e.g. WPF/UWP/JavaFX, and lacks a
  `SKILL.md`). We vendored the already-built `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/`
  directory: `SKILL.md`, `data/*.csv` (styles, colors, typography, product
  types, UX guidelines, charts, and 16 per-stack CSVs including
  `react-native.csv`), and `scripts/*.py` (a small BM25 search engine over
  the CSVs). No CLI or database initialization is required — the scripts are
  self-contained stdlib Python 3 that read the local CSVs directly.
- **`ponytail`** — upstream repo ships the same "lazy senior dev" behavior as
  a skill, a slash command, and native integrations for several other coding
  agents (Cursor rules, Cline rules, Windsurf rules, OpenCode plugin, Gemini
  extension, Codex/Devin plugins, etc.), plus a family of sibling skills
  (`ponytail-audit`, `ponytail-debt`, `ponytail-gain`, `ponytail-help`,
  `ponytail-review`) not requested here. Only the Claude-Code-relevant piece
  was vendored: `skills/ponytail/SKILL.md`, which is already a complete,
  self-contained Claude Code skill (valid `name:`/`description:`/`license:`
  frontmatter, no external references). The plugin/hook/command scaffolding
  for other agents was left upstream, not vendored.

## `ponytail` vs the built-in `/simplify` skill — when to use which

Both push toward less/simpler code, but they act at different points in the
workflow and with different scope:

| | `ponytail` (vendored) | `/simplify` (built-in) |
|---|---|---|
| **When it runs** | Proactively, while code is being written — a standing posture ("ACTIVE EVERY RESPONSE") that shapes the first draft of a solution. | Reactively, after a diff already exists — reviews changed code and applies fixes. |
| **Scope** | Any coding task, any file, before a line is written: "does this need to exist", stdlib-first, fewest files, YAGNI. | The current diff only: reuse, simplification, efficiency, and "altitude" cleanups on code that's already there. |
| **Output style** | Governs the *shape* of the solution itself (ladder of "simplest thing that holds"), plus terse output discipline (code first, ≤3 lines of explanation). | A review pass — reports/applies findings, doesn't dictate how the original code should have been written. |
| **Use when** | Starting a new task, feature, or fix, especially if there's a risk of over-engineering it from the outset, or the user says "keep it simple" / "lazy mode" / "yagni". | After implementation, before committing/PR — a final quality pass on a diff that's otherwise done, independent of whether ponytail was active while writing it. |

In short: reach for `ponytail` to shape how code gets written in the first
place; reach for `/simplify` to clean up code that's already written. They're
complementary, not redundant — running `/simplify` after a ponytail-written
diff is still useful (it catches leftover complexity ponytail's per-response
posture missed), and running ponytail doesn't replace a review pass before
merge.

## Re-syncing a vendored skill

To pick up upstream changes, re-run that skill's re-sync command above, then
diff the result against the currently vendored folder before committing —
upstream authors may rename files, change frontmatter, or (as with
`ui-ux-pro-max`) restructure between a "source" layout and a "built" layout.
After re-syncing, re-run the frontmatter check from Task 24:

```bash
for f in .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  grep -q "^name:" "$f" && grep -q "^description:" "$f" || echo "BAD: $f"
done
```

Commit format for a re-sync: `chore(skill): re-sync <name> to <short-sha>`.
