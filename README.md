# Claude Code Full‑Stack Template

A native‑first Claude Code starter template for building an **Expo mobile app + NestJS API**
monorepo through a disciplined Brainstorm → Design → Layer → Implement → Test → Checkpoint → Refine
workflow.

## What this is

This repo is **not** a finished app — it's a template. It ships a complete pnpm + Turborepo
monorepo skeleton, plus a full Claude Code "native engine" (skills, subagents, slash commands,
hooks, `settings.json`) that drives you through building your own product from a one‑line idea to
a tested, CI‑gated codebase.

It is **native‑first**: instead of simulating the workflow with plain markdown instructions, it
uses Claude Code's own primitives — skills, subagents, slash commands, hooks, `settings.json`, and
Plan Mode — as the actual workflow engine.

`apps/mobile`, `apps/api`, and `packages/shared` ship **empty** (only a `.gitkeep` each). They are
scaffolded for real during your project's own **Layer 0**, once your design spec is approved — this
template only provides the monorepo configuration around them.

The template is tuned for a product that wants **smooth UI and beautiful animations** with React
Native Reanimated v4 — the mobile foundation and an authored animation skill bake in the Reanimated
4 essentials and gotchas from day one.

**HARD GATE:** no code, no scaffolding, no `apps/*` changes before a design spec has been written to
`docs/specs/` and approved by you. A fresh clone has an empty `docs/specs/`, which is exactly what
triggers Phase 0 automatically the moment you open the repo in Claude Code.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code) — CLI, desktop app, web (claude.ai/code), or IDE extension. This is the engine that runs the template's workflow (skills, subagents, slash commands, hooks); it's a build/assist dependency, not a runtime one — the Expo app and NestJS API you produce run without it.
- Node.js ≥ 20
- pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm@9` if you don't have it)
- git
- For mobile development: Watchman, Xcode (iOS) and/or Android Studio (Android)
- Optional: [`graphify`](https://github.com/Graphify-Labs/graphify) + [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for the `/graph`
  command (codebase dependency graphing)

## Quick start

```bash
./scripts/start-project.sh
```

This asks for your project name and either an existing spec/brain‑dump file or a quick description,
then writes `docs/BRIEF.md` (and `docs/SPECIFICATIONS.md` if you provided one) and makes sure
`docs/specs/` is empty so Phase 0 will trigger.

Then:

1. Open the folder in Claude Code.
2. `CLAUDE.md`'s hard gate detects there's no design doc in `docs/specs/` yet and Phase 0 starts
   automatically — Claude will brainstorm your idea with you one question at a time.
3. Once you approve a design, run `/scope-breakdown` to generate `tasks/layer-0-todo.md`, then
   `/run-layer` to start implementing.

Windows users can run `scripts/start-project.ps1` or `scripts/start-project.bat` instead.

## Workflow summary

```
Fresh clone (no design in docs/specs/)
  → PHASE 0 (Plan Mode, HARD GATE): /phase-0 → brainstorming skill → design doc → user approve
  → SCOPE BREAKDOWN: /scope-breakdown → scope-planner → tasks/layer-*.md
       (Layer 0 = scaffold Expo + API + shared + base config + CI)
  → LAYER LOOP (per layer):
       /run-layer → task-implementer (per-task worktree) → merge → code-reviewer → test-writer
       /next-layer  [gate: all tests pass]
  → BETWEEN LAYERS: /checkpoint → CHECKPOINT.md (+ compact context); /learn; /graph
  → REFINEMENT: user reports bug/feature → /refine → brainstorm → layer-refinement-todo.md → implement
```

Three discipline gates hold this together: (1) no code before the spec is approved; (2) no
advancing to the next layer before its tests pass; (3) no hard‑coded secrets — use `.env` /
`packages/shared/config` only. See `docs/WORKFLOW.md` for the full guide.

## Slash commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/phase-0` | Enter Plan Mode, run the `brainstorming` skill, write the approved design to `docs/specs/` (HARD GATE — no code first) |
| `/scope-breakdown` | Dispatch the `scope-planner` subagent against the approved spec → create `tasks/layer-*.md` |
| `/pick-task` | Show the next task in the current layer and load its relevant skills |
| `/run-layer` | Fan out independent tasks in the current layer to worktree‑isolated `task-implementer` subagents, merge, then run `code-reviewer` |
| `/next-layer` | Verify the layer's tests pass, advance `tasks/done.md`, create the next layer, bump "Current Layer" in `CLAUDE.md` |
| `/checkpoint` | Generate `CHECKPOINT.md` (git log + `done.md` + key decisions) and compact context |
| `/learn` | Extract patterns/gotchas from the finished layer into `.learnings/` |
| `/graph` | Run `graphify` over the monorepo and summarize `GRAPH_REPORT.md` |
| `/refine` | Brainstorm a reported bug/feature, then append it to `tasks/layer-refinement-todo.md` |
| `/security-review` | Run `security-review` over a diff/PR/path → high-confidence security findings |
| `/threat-model` | Run `security-threat-model` on a named feature before implementation |

## Animation

Reanimated v4 requires the **New Architecture** (`newArchEnabled: true` in `app.json`), and worklets
now live in a separate `react-native-worklets` package. The `expo-router-nativewind` foundation
skill wires this up; `mobile-animations` is the recipe library (scroll‑driven 3D cards,
swipe‑to‑island morph, gesture interactions, carousels, Skia effects); `motion-design-principles`
decides *whether and how much* to animate a given interaction (honoring `useReducedMotion()`,
200–350ms durations, springs, and UI‑thread‑only work) before `mobile-animations` is used to
implement it.

## CI/CD

Five GitHub Actions workflows live in `.github/workflows/`:

- `ci.yml` — on every PR/push: `pnpm turbo run lint typecheck test`
- `security.yml` — on every PR/push: Gitleaks (secrets), Semgrep (SAST), `pnpm audit` (dependencies)
- `eas-preview.yml` — builds an EAS preview profile from `develop` / manual dispatch
- `eas-production.yml` — manual, gated EAS production build (+ optional submit)
- `api-deploy.yml` — builds the API Docker image; the actual hosting deploy step is left as a
  provider‑agnostic placeholder for you to fill in

`.github/dependabot.yml` runs alongside these: weekly `npm` updates across the workspace and
`github-actions` updates for the workflows themselves.

See `docs/CI_CD.md` for required secrets and gate rules.
